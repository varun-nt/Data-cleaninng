# Data-cleaning
Cleaning exercises of datasets through Excel
Here is a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows containing approximately 8,000 unique entries downloaded from Kaggle. 
There is a raw data sheet and then the cleaned one. During the cleaning process, I used the TRIM and PROPER commands, then pasted everything as values to make it a static datatype instead of a formula. Then, I highlighted all missing values with CTRL+G and replaced them with "NOT AVAILABLE," then highlighted the new values using conditional formatting. In the end, all data types were fixed such as adding dates as DD-MM-YYYY and other minor changes to obtain a proper, clean dataset for future analysis.
